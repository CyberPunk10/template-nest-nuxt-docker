# .env[.example]

Variables for docker compose: the names and ports Compose needs to know **before** the containers start. The applications themselves don't read this file — they have their own `.env`. But when running through Docker, values from here reach the containers via `environment` in `docker-compose.yml`, which takes precedence over `apps/*/.env`.

| Variable                 | Value  | Comment                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NGINX_HOST_PORT`        | `80`   | The only published port — the entry point for all traffic              |
| `NGINX_INTERNAL_PORT`    | `80`   | The port nginx listens on inside the container                         |
| `BACKEND_INTERNAL_PORT`  | `3100` | Backend port **inside the container**; not published                   |
| `FRONTEND_INTERNAL_PORT` | `3200` | Frontend port inside the container; not published                      |
| `COMPOSE_NETWORK_NAME`   | `template-nest-nuxt_app` | Name of the shared Docker network. Read by both `docker-compose.yml` and `ensure-network.mjs`. The network is declared `external` — Compose doesn't create it, `pnpm docker:up` does — [details](/en/guide/structure/docker-compose#network) |

The documentation takes no port of its own — its static files are built straight into the reverse proxy image.

## Who reads this

Variables from here fan out to several consumers. Changing them is safer than it looks, since the value is set in one place.

- `BACKEND_INTERNAL_PORT` and `FRONTEND_INTERNAL_PORT` — into the containers' `expose`, into the applications' own `PORT`, into the `NUXT_BACKEND_URL` address for the frontend, and into the nginx config it proxies from.
- `NGINX_INTERNAL_PORT` — into the `listen` directive of the nginx config and into publishing the port outward.

Under `pnpm dev` these variables play no part: ports come from `PORT` in `apps/*/.env` — [both modes explained](/en/guide/env-variables#ports).
