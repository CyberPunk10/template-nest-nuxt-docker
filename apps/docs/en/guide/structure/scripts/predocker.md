# predocker.mjs

Runs automatically before `pnpm docker:up` — via the npm `pre*` convention.

It does three things:

1. **Copies `.env.example` → `.env`** for all four files at once (root, `apps/backend`, `apps/frontend`, `apps/docs`) — via the shared `copyEnvFiles()` from [`copy-env.mjs`](/en/guide/structure/scripts/copy-env).
2. **Checks the port and resolves conflicts** — via the shared `checkPorts()` from [`check-ports.mjs`](/en/guide/structure/scripts/check-ports). On conflict it offers a dialog: kill the process holding the port or abort the run.
3. **Creates the Docker network** if it doesn't exist yet — via [`ensure-network.mjs`](/en/guide/structure/scripts/ensure-network). The name comes from `COMPOSE_NETWORK_NAME` in the root `.env` — the same source `docker-compose.yml` reads. Repeat runs do nothing.

Only one port is checked — `NGINX_HOST_PORT` from the root `.env`. Backend and frontend take no host ports at all: they live on the internal network. The database port is published, but stays out of the check — Docker holds it, and on an already running database that would be a false conflict.

::: warning
This only runs before `pnpm docker:up`, not before a direct `docker compose up`. If you call `docker compose up` directly, bypassing the npm wrapper, on a fresh clone without `.env` files — the command refuses to start: the port variables in `docker-compose.yml` have no defaults (`no port specified` without a root `.env`), and `env_file` for `apps/*/.env` is required by default (`env file ... not found`). There's also no explicit port-conflict check — if a host port is taken, you'll get a plain Docker `address already in use` error, with no dialog offering to free it up. Create the missing `.env` files ahead of time, without running anything: `pnpm env:copy`.

The local-development counterpart — [`predev.mjs`](/en/guide/structure/scripts/predev).

## Usage

It runs on its own — no need to call it separately:

```bash
pnpm docker:up
```

npm sees the `predocker:up` script and runs it before `docker:up`. To run only the preparation, without starting the containers:

```bash
pnpm predocker:up
```
