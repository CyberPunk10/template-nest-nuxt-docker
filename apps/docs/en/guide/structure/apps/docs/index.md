# apps/docs

VitePress. Pages are plain markdown files; the path to a file becomes its URL.

## Three locales

Russian is the primary one and lives at the root (`/guide/...`). English and Thai live in subdirectories mirroring the same tree (`/en/guide/...`).

The page structure is **identical** across locales: add a file to `guide/` and add it to `en/guide/` and `th/guide/` too, otherwise the sidebars drift apart. The sidebar itself is defined per locale in `.vitepress/config/`.

## A Dockerfile that runs nothing

The `apps/docs` image starts no process: it only builds the static files that the nginx image picks up. There is no separate docs container in Compose — see [Dockerfile](/en/guide/structure/apps/docs/docker-image).

Application scripts — [package.json](/en/guide/structure/apps/docs/package-json).
